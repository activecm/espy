# Redis Connection Details
# Espy uses Redis to collect network logs from individual agents. This section
# configures the Espy service to connect to Redis and begin processing
# the incoming logs.
# Do not change these settings if Espy is running with the provided Docker configuration.
Redis:
  # Ex: Host: "127.0.0.1:6379"
  Host: "redis-server:6379"
  # Ex: User: "joe.blow"
  User: "net-receiver"
  # Ex: Password: "password"
  Password: "NET_RECEIVER_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER"
  # TLS should be enabled if Redis is running on a separate machine
  TLS:
    Enable: true
    # If set, Espy will check the Redis certificate's hostname and signatures
    VerifyCertificate: false
    #If set, Espy will use the provided CA file instead of the system's CA's
    CAFile: ""

# Elasticsearch Connection Details
# Espy will forward incoming network logs from Redis onto Elasticsearch
# if the Elasticsearch Host is set.
Elasticsearch:
  # Ex: Host: "127.0.0.1:9200"
  Host: ""
  # Ex: User: "elastic"
  User: ""
  # Ex: Password: "elatic's password"
  Password: ""
  # TLS should be enabled if Redis is running on a separate machine
  TLS:
    Enable: false
    # If set, Espy will check the ES certificate's hostname and signatures
    VerifyCertificate: false
    #If set, Espy will use the provided CA file instead of the system's CA's
    CAFile: ""

# Zeek Output Details
# Espy writes incoming network logs out to Zeek files for processing
# with tools compatible with Zeek's TSV file format
# Do not change these settings if Espy is running with the provided Docker configuration.
# To change the Zeek output folder while using the provided Docker configuration,
# configure ESPY_ZEEK_LOGS in /etc/espy/env.
Zeek:
  # Path to write Zeek files to. Environment variables are supported.
  # Ex: "$HOME/zeek/logs"
  Path: "/opt/zeek/logs"
  # If set to false, Espy will write every log entry to the same file
  # rather than hourly rotated files
  RotateLogs: true

# Espy log level controls how much Espy writes to stdout
# Fatal: 1; Only log errors that result in crashing
# Error: 2; Log critical errors as well
# Warn:  3; Log all errors
# Info:  4; Verbose output
# Debug: 5; Very verbose. May impact performance.
LogLevel: 3
